Mix of tetris and candy crush

pieces not limited to tetrominoes, including 1 to 4 or 5 block pieces, with each square being a different color.
Lines do not clear, blocks are instead cleared by 3 or more blocks of the same color touching and being removed. 
Blocks above cleared blocks will cascade.
